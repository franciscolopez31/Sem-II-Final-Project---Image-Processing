Sem II Final Project 
Version 3 contains an easier way for the user to interact with the code without
having to type in huge words, or my help to guide them through it.
Description: I will modify different bmp images and give them certain image
effects. They will either get a regular or reverse outline effect, a vertical
or horizontal mirror effect or a static effect. 
On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unacknowledged aid on this
assignment.
